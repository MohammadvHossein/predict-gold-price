# Gold Price Prediction Project

Welcome to the Gold Price Prediction Project! This repository contains a Python-based application designed to forecast gold prices using advanced quantitative analysis, machine learning, and deep learning techniques. 

## Features
- **Data Collection**: Historical gold price data and relevant economic indicators.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implementation of various algorithms, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
- **Deep Learning Models**: Utilization of LSTM and CNN architectures for enhanced prediction accuracy.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Comprehensive metrics to assess model performance.
- **Visualization Tools**: Graphical representations of predictions versus actual prices.
